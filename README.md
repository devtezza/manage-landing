## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- [SASS](https://sass-lang.com/) - SASS library
- [GlideJS](https://glidejs.com/) - Glide JS library for carousel
- [PristineJS](https://pristine.js.org/) - Vanilla javascript form validation micro-library

### Useful resources

- [CSS Filter Generator](https://codepen.io/sosuke/pen/Pjoqqp) - This tool calculates the correct values of CSS filter property functions to generate a desired color. It helped me to change the color of svg icons on hover state.
- [vanilla-navbar-menu](https://github.com/heyrizaldev/vanilla-navbar-menu) - It helped me to get a hint on how to build a responsive menu with no framework (only pure CSS/SASS and Javascript). I just adapted the code to fit my needs on this challenge.
